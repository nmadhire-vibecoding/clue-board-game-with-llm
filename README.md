# Clue Board Game with LLM Agents

[![Build Status](https://github.com/nmadhire-vibecoding/clue-board-game-with-llm/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nmadhire-vibecoding/clue-board-game-with-llm/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)


A multi-agent implementation of the classic Clue (Cluedo) board game using CrewAI and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM. Six AI agents compete to solve the murder mystery following the **official game rules** from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo#Rules).

## Agent Autonomy: Perceive, Reason, Plan, Act

Each agent in this game is fully autonomous and follows a structured decision-making loop on every turn:

1. **Perceive**: The agent observes its environment and gathers all available information (cards, location, notebook, event log, etc.).
2. **Reason**: The agent analyzes its observations, updates its detective notebook, and deduces what is known or unknown.
3. **Plan**: The agent formulates a plan to achieve its goal (solving the mystery), deciding whether to move, suggest, or accuse.
4. **Act**: The agent executes its plan by using the appropriate tools (move, make a suggestion, record results, or make an accusation).

This loop ensures that each agent acts independently, adapts to new information, and makes strategic decisions throughout the game. The autonomy structure is enforced in the code and validated by tests.


## Game Overview

In this game, 6 AI players investigate a murder at Tudor Mansion:
- **Who** committed the crime (6 suspects)
- **What** weapon was used (6 weapons)  
- **Where** the crime took place (9 rooms)



Each player uses deduction and strategy to be the first to solve the mystery, autonomously following the perceive → reason → plan → act loop!

## Official Rules Implemented

Based on the [official Cluedo rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo#Rules):

### Game Flow

```
SETUP:
  1. Randomly select 1 suspect, 1 weapon, 1 room -> place in SOLUTION ENVELOPE
  2. Shuffle remaining 18 cards and deal to all players
  3. Each player records their cards in their Detective Notebook
  4. Miss Scarlet goes first (or highest dice roll)

TURN ORDER (clockwise from Miss Scarlet):

           v
  +------------------+
  | IN A ROOM?       |--NO--> End turn, next player
  +--------+---------+
           | YES
           v
  +------------------+
  | MAKE SUGGESTION  |  "I suggest it was [SUSPECT] with the [WEAPON]
  | (optional)       |   in the [CURRENT ROOM]"
  +--------+---------+
           |
           v
  +------------------+
  | DISPROVAL        |  Clockwise from you:
  | (automatic)      |  - Each player checks if they have any suggested card
  +--------+---------+  - First player with a match shows you ONE card (secret)
           |            - If no one can disprove -> STRONG LEAD!
           v
  +------------------+
  | MAKE ACCUSATION  |  "I accuse [SUSPECT] with the [WEAPON]
  | (optional)       |   in the [ROOM]" (can be any room!)
  +--------+---------+
           |
      +----+----+

  | WIN! |  | ELIMINATED       |
  +------+  | (still disprove) |
            +------------------+
           |
           v
  +------------------+
  |   END TURN       |  -> Next player clockwise
  +------------------+

WINNING CONDITIONS:
  - Make a correct accusation, OR
  - Be the last active player (all others eliminated)
```

## Detective Notebook

LLMs are notoriously bad at maintaining long-term logic across many turns. To solve this, each agent has a **deterministic Detective Notebook** that:

- Tracks card ownership in a grid (Card x Player)
- Records all suggestions and outcomes
- Auto-deduces solution when all players don't have a card
- Provides strategic suggestions based on current knowledge
- **Validates suggestions** - Warns when suggesting known cards (wastes a turn)
- **Validates accusations** - BLOCKS accusations that contradict notebook (prevents elimination)
- **Recommends accusations** - Tells agent when all 3 categories narrowed to 1 option

This prevents the AI from "forgetting" crucial information during the game!
