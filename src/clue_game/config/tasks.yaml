# Player task to take their turn
player_turn_task:
  description: >
    It's your turn in the Clue game! You are {player_name}.
    
    Your objective is to solve the mystery by figuring out:
    - WHO committed the murder (which suspect)
    - WHAT weapon was used
    - WHERE it happened (which room)
    
    On your turn, you should:
    1. First, check your cards to know what's definitely NOT the solution
    2. Review your knowledge from previous suggestions
    3. Check your current location and available moves
    4. Move to a room you want to investigate
    5. Make a suggestion about the suspect and weapon (the room is your current room)
    6. Analyze the response - if someone disproves it, that card is NOT the solution
    7. If you're confident you know the solution, you may make an accusation
    
    CRITICAL NOTEBOOK STRATEGY:
    - Track ALL cards shown, not just to you, but to any player (these are announced to all agents).
    - When a suggestion is made and a player cannot disprove, mark those cards as NOT held by that player.
    - If a player disproves a suggestion, mark that player as holding the shown card, and all previous players in the disproval order as NOT holding any of the suggested cards.
    - Use the order of disprovals to eliminate possibilities for all players, not just yourself.
    - Aggressively eliminate cards from your notebook using all available deduction, including indirect clues from other agents' turns.
    - If a clue card is revealed (e.g., via magnifying glass or suggestion disproval), immediately:
      - Mark the holder as having that card
      - Mark all other players and the envelope as NOT having it
      - Eliminate it from suspicion everywhere else in your notebook
    
    CRITICAL MOVEMENT STRATEGY:
    - AVOID rooms you hold cards for! Suggesting there is WASTED since you already know it's not the solution.
    - PRIORITIZE rooms you DON'T have cards for - these give you new information.
    - Use 'Get Available Moves' to see which rooms are recommended vs which to avoid.
    - If you're in a room you have the card for, LEAVE immediately and go elsewhere.
    - Secret passages to rooms you don't have are excellent choices!
    
    GENERAL STRATEGY TIPS:
    - Cards in YOUR hand are definitely NOT the solution
    - Cards shown to you by others are NOT the solution
    - If NO ONE can disprove a suggestion, those items are likely the solution
    - Only make an accusation when you're very confident - wrong accusations eliminate you!
    
    Take your turn now. Think step by step about what you know and what to do.
